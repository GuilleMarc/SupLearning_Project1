    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "### ***Answer Question 2: Model Election\n",
    "My three models to predict potential donors based on socio-demographics were: Logistic regression, Naive Bayes, and Random Forests as an Ensemble method.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Logistic regression:\n",
    "Applications: logistic regression is useful to model relationships where the response is binary in nature. The responses are usually log-transformed and modeled as probabilities connected to a linear combination of the predictors via a sigmoidal function. The marketing research department of a cola-drink company can use logistic regression, for example, to predict whether consumers will purchase a new version of its top selling product or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "Strenghts: It can be relatively easier and faster to implement than other complex algorithms. In the end, it is an extension of linear regression to model binary election problems. Because of its simplicity, it can be trained quickly and set the basis for benchmarking against more complex, and perhaps, more accurate algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses: Logistic regression can be very sensitive to attributes that are poorly related to the outcome we want to predict and can lead to overfitting (i.e great training yet poor testing performance).\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is a good choice here because predicting potential donors is in terms of classifying between two categories (i.e. income above or below 50k).\n",

    "### Implementation - Creating a Training and Predicting Pipeline\n",
    "To properly evaluate the performance of each model you've chosen, it's important that you create a training and predicting pipeline that allows you to quickly and effectively train models using various sizes of training data and perform predictions on the testing data. Your implementation here will be used in the following section.\n",
    "In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Import `fbeta_score` and `accuracy_score` from [`sklearn.metrics`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#sklearn-metrics-metrics).\n",
    " - Fit the learner to the sampled training data and record the training time.\n",
    " - Perform predictions on the test data `X_test`, and also on the first 300 training points `X_train[:300]`.\n",
    "   - Record the total prediction time.\n",
    " - Calculate the accuracy score for both the training subset and testing set.\n",
    " - Calculate the F-score for both the training subset and testing set.\n",

    "The algorithm that better predict potential donors using our demographic dataset was the logistic regression. The logistic regression F-score was 0.68 when testing it against 100% of the training data. It compared relatively higher than the ensemble (Random Forests, F=0.66), and consistently outperformed the other \"benchmark\" I chose for this problem: naive bayes classifier. Computation time for the three methods increased with sample size as expected, but logistic regression took consistently less time to train and test compared to random forests. Roughly, testing the model with the full dataset took 3.5 times less with the logistic than the random forest classifier. Finally, besides performance and time savings, the logistic regression proved to be a great choice given the binary nature of the response we are trying to predict, which is classifying between individuals who make above or below 50k annually."

    "\n",
    "Based on a suite of socio-economic conditions, logistic regression allows us to predict whether a person belongs to one of two categores, that is, whether he or she is more likely to earn 50k dollars per year or not. Simply put, logistic regression implements a few mathematical tricks by which our predictions take on a probability between 0 and 1. Thus, every time a new observation (i.e. a a person) is considered, the algorithm picks its corresponding socio-economic attributes, feed them into an equation, predicts its outome, and applies a decision-rule. The decision is something along the lines of: If this person-predicted response is 0.5 or above, then label him or her as someone most likely to make 50k a year (prediction=1 with potential to become a donor to CharityML). Conversely, if the predicted outcome for an individual is below 0.5, then he or she is most likely to make less than 50k, and hence, is less likely to contribute. \n",
    "\n",
    "Modeling is part art, part science, and as such, it involves several steps. Up to now, logistic regression was able to accurately classify 80% of individuals who had made 50k or more after several rounds of testing. At this point, logistic regression proved to be effective and faster to run, but there is still additional work to do to improve or \"tune\" it, specially, when we have to test it against new observations. I will be working on some of these extra steps in the next sections."

    "Both accuracy and the combined F-score remained unchanged for the logistic regression after optimization. I had though that given the high dimensionality we enforced with the one-hot dummy encoding of our data, we could reduce the likelihood of overfitting by 1) regularizing the model, and 2) adjusting weights proportionally to the inputs, much like in a weighted regression. As it turns out, model performance remained the same yet was shown to be much better relative to the naive benchmark suggested (i.e. 25% accurate donor identification by pure chance), and a more elegant naive approach I proposed (Naive bayes: 79%).\n",
    "Relative to the zero improvement of my regularized logistic regression, Sebastian Raschka (a great data scientist I admire), has pointed out in a KD nuggets post, that regularizing a logistic model penalizes complexity and helps improving generalization of its performance only when testing it against new data. He implies that regularization should not \"improve\" performance on the training dataset, which I did.\n",

    "\n",
    "The ranking for important features with the random forest classifier agreed pretty much with my intuition. Education, capital gains, and hours-per-week were important, but contrary to what I had expected, sex and occupation were found not influential in predicting potential donors for Chariry ML. Surprisingly, age and household role were shown to be hihgly influential to predict potential donors to the charity. Out of the effects I overlooked, possibly household-role as a husband may be capturing some of the gender gap effects I mentioned initially while age may be an indicative of seniority, and arguably could be related to higher salaries and higher likelihoods to become a donor.

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "The Performance of the logistic regression did not improve with the reduced model. Both the F-score and accuracy scores after reducing the dataset remained unchanged, at 0.6 and 0.8 respectively. For this dataset, computation time was not particularly concerning, but if this model were set to production, reducing feature space would probably bring time savings. Also, we identified attributes of importance with an ensemble method, yet I wonder that maybe another approach suited for variable selection in linear models could be implemented for this logistic regression, such as recursive variable selection."
