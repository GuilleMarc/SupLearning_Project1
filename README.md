## Project: Finding Donors for CharityML

### Descriptions

The following project is an  implementation of machine learning for a classification
problem. CharityML is a fictitious charity organization that relies upon donations to support people with an interest in machine learning. To avoid excess mailing and operational costs, CharityML wants to target potential donors based on a predictive system which identifies individuals who meet or exceed a certain income threshold. Starting from census based data from 1994, the project builds a pipeline going from cleaning and preprocessing data in the right formats, up to choosing and optimizing the best among three candidate models.

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)


### Code

Code to run the project, as well as explanations and notes about it, included
as a jupyter notebook: `finding_donors.ipynb`

Additional functions required to run visualizations are included in the
'visuals.py' file.


### Run
You can fork the repository, navigate to the top-level project directory
`finding_donors/` (that contains this README), and run the notebook from a
terminal (bash/windows).
I recommend install and run using [Ananconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)
### Data

Modified from 1994-census with 32,000 observations. Each entry represents
an individual described by 13 socio-economic features. This dataset is a
modified version of the dataset published in the paper
*"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: a Decision-Tree Hybrid",*
by Ron Kohavi.
